## Welcome to tkasasagi's homepage

Hi! My name is Tarin Clanuwat. I am originally from Thailand, but now living and working in Japan. I got my PhD in Classical Japanese Literature (文学) from Waseda University, Graduate School of Arts Letters and Science. I specialized in the Tale of Genji's commentary books from Kamakura and Nambokucho period.

### Media List

```markdown
Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/tkasasagi/tkasasagi.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
