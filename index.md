# Welcome to tkasasagi's homepage

My name is Tarin Clanuwat. I am originally from Thailand, but now living and working in Japan. I got my PhD in Classical Japanese Literature (文学) from Waseda University, Graduate School of Arts Letters and Science. I specialized in the Tale of Genji's commentary books from Kamakura and Nambokucho period. You can reach me at tkasasagi at gmail.

## My Research

My current research interest is mainly on Kuzushiji or pre-modern Japanese character recognition with deep learning. I also worked on datasets for machine learning such as KMNIST dataset and KaoKore dataset. I am interested in encouraging humanities researchers to use machine learning and data science in their research because the research in classical literature or history deals with a lot of data all the time.
